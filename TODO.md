## To- Do List:

1. Understand the Mathematical Model in Dr. Vale's paper.  
2. Understand the code in the:
    * Model fitting script: fit_model12.R
    * Simulation script: simulate_model12.R
    * Inference script: inference_test_model12.R
    * Plotting script:
3. Write Python code concurrently as each script is understood
    * Test each script to ensure output is same as the R output.
4. Reproduce results exactly, or within precision, in Python
5. Update manuscript to reflect progress
6. Create new script that samples hierarchical model using Negative Binomial Prior -- may have to figure out alternative smoothing method.
7. Update manuscript to reflect progress.
    * Potential stopping point for project
8. Consider alternative model modifications.
